Spaced repetition is a centuries-old psychological technique for efficient memorization & practice of skills where instead of attempting to memorize by [en:: cramming] [it:: stipare], **memorization can be done far more efficiently by instead spacing out each review, with increasing durations as one learns the item, with the scheduling done by software**.
Because of the greater efficiency of its slow but steady approach, spaced repetition can scale to memorizing hundreds of thousands of items (while crammed items are almost immediately forgotten) and is especially useful for foreign languages & medical studies.

The spacing effect essentially says that if you have a question (“What is the fifth letter in this random sequence you learned?”), and you can only study it, say, 5 times, then your memory of the answer (‘e’) will be strongest if you spread your 5 tries out over a long period of time - days, weeks, and months.
One of the worst things you can do is [en:: blow] [it:: soffio, colpo] your 5 tries within a day or two.
You can think of the ‘[forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)’ as being like a chart of a radioactive [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life): **each review bumps your memory up in strength 50% of the chart, say, but review doesn’t do much in the early days because the memory simply hasn’t decayed much**!

Even better, it’s known that [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall) is a far superior method of learning than simply passively being exposed to information.

Knowledge needs to accumulate, and **flashcards with spaced repetition can aid in just that accumulation**, [en:: fostering] [it:: favorendo] steady review even as the number of cards and intellectual prerequisites mounts into the ⁠thousands.
It doesn’t help that it’s pretty difficult to figure out _when_ one should review - the optimal point is when you’re just about to forget about it, but that’s the [en:: kicker] [it:: pezzo forte]: **if you’re just about to forget about it, how are you supposed to remember to review it? You only remember to review what you remember, and what you already remember isn’t what you need to review!⁠
The paradox is resolved by letting a computer handle all the calculations**. This is the insight behind spaced repetition software: **ask the same question over and over, but over increasing spans of time**. You start with asking it once every few days, and soon the human remembers it reasonably well. Then you expand intervals out to weeks, then months, and then years.
Once the memory is formed and dispatched to long-term memory, it needs but occasional exercise to remain [en::hale] [it:: sano, robusto]and healthy⁠.
