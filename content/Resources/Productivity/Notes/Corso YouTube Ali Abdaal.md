To begin with, if you‚Äôre not fully convinced YouTube can utterly change your life, here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs changed mine:

##  **![üí∞](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4b0/32.png) 1: Money**

Let‚Äôs be honest money is a fairly important driver for many things we do. I‚Äôve been pretty transparent about my earnings so I might as well use them to make this point. Just through YouTube and the audience I‚Äôve built with it, I‚Äôve now turned this hobby into a business which generated [$4.7 million last year](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u2vq03x4squmwm28b6/e0hph7hkmlxlq2b7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1Ub3o3WEVzU0hfbyZ0PTE2NDRz) which is absolutely mindblowingly insane.

Back in 2019 I was working around 10 hours on the channel most weeks (on evenings and weekends) and still making more money than I was earning in my full-time job as a doctor.

Now I‚Äôve got complete financial freedom, plus a team of 20 people, and it‚Äôs all down to starting this whole YouTube thing ![ü§Ø](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f92f/32.png)

##  **![üåé](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f30e/32.png) 2: Work Anywhere in the World**

When the world isn‚Äôt ending, you might be someone who dreams of/enjoys travelling, or you might just prefer staying home instead of braving the daily commute. Either way, all you need is a laptop and camera and you can work from anywhere at any time. It‚Äôs pretty cool.

##  **![üïä](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f54a/32.png) 3: Freedom**

Morgan Housel, author of [_The Psychology of Money_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u2vq03x4squmwm28b6/7qh7h8h0d6g6w4s9/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzLzVvcGMzUA==), says the value of money is that it gives you ‚Äúthe ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want to.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs what YouTube can give you ![‚úåÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/270c_fe0f/32.png)

My team and I have all our meetings on a Monday, so then I have the rest of the week free to film videos, write my book, go to the gym and hang out with my friends pretty much as I please. You don‚Äôt have to quit your day job, but you might get to a place where you don‚Äôt have to be there either. Work becomes a choice.

##  **![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2764_fe0f/32.png) 4: Heroes and Friendships**

It‚Äôs a lot easier to get a reply from your personal heroes when you can give them something back (exposure in a video for example). YouTube‚Äôs allowed me to connect with people I could only dream of, and at the same time it‚Äôs led to some amazing people getting in touch with me. Without YouTube, I doubt our paths would‚Äôve ever crossed ![ü§ù](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f91d/32.png)

Life is really about connections and interactions, and YouTube is genuinely a brilliant way to supercharge both.

##  **![üíå](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f48c/32.png) 5: Changing Lives**

One thing that never gets old is people writing in to say you‚Äôve changed their lives. Although I do get a bit of imposter syndrome every time, there‚Äôs nothing more heartwarming than someone actually saying you‚Äôve changed their life.

Bringing these little bits of happiness, positive change (or even humour with others making fun of you lol) is such a big plus.

##  **![üí•](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4a5/32.png) 6: Impact**

The most insane thing that‚Äôs come from this journey has been the level of impact me and my community of subscribers have had on other people‚Äôs lives.

One [video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u2vq03x4squmwm28b6/owhkhqh4x6z6g4uq/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_YWJfY2hhbm5lbD1BbGlBYmRhYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyJnY9UEhnZFhXWkxzOWc=) I made on the Giving What You Can Pledge made $1 million in extra pledges, saving approximately 400 lives. (It costs approx $2500 to save a human life through donations to the Against Malaria Foundation). This is way more than I ever saved when I was a doctor. (For context, the average doctor saves around 20 lives in their entire career ([source](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/n4u2vq03x4squmwm28b6/z2hghnho5kgkp3cz/aHR0cHM6Ly84MDAwMGhvdXJzLm9yZy8yMDEyLzA5L2hvdy1tYW55LWxpdmVzLWRvZXMtYS1kb2N0b3Itc2F2ZS1wYXJ0LTMtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtODQvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1BbGklMjdzJTIwUGFydC1UaW1lJTIwWW91VHViZXIlMjBDcmFzaC1Db3Vyc2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlciM6fjp0ZXh0PVRoZSUyMGltcGFjdCUyMG9mJTIwbWFyZ2luYWwlMjBkb2N0b3JzLGludGVydmFsJTIwb2YlMjA2MDAlMkQ5MjAlMjBRQUxZcy4mdGV4dD0yMCUyMGxpdmVz))).

Puts things into perspective and makes you realise the crazy potential that can come from making silly videos on the internet ![üòú](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f61c/32.png)

##  **![üöÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/32.png) 7: It‚Äôs Really Fun**

Honestly, making YouTube videos is a blast ![üòé](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f60e/32.png)

It‚Äôs scary initially, but you learn so much with each video, and when you hit _publish_ it‚Äôs like your little creation is going out into the world. Then you get the views, the likes and the comments, which are wholesome and supportive 99.9% of the time.

You find yourself improving over time, you start getting messages from friends saying they saw your video and they thought it was cool. It‚Äôs all pretty fun.

##  **![‚åõÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/231b_fe0f/32.png) Myth 1: It‚Äôs Too Late To Get Started**

For a fairly new platform, it feels like YouTube‚Äôs been around for a while. We‚Äôve already seen the rise and fall of a bunch of YouTubers. Half of your favourites might be people with millions of subscribers. It‚Äôs easy to see all that, not know where the ‚Äòupload video‚Äô button is and think ‚Äò_this ship‚Äôs sailed‚Äô, ‚Äòwhy would someone watch me‚Äô, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt compete‚Äô._

The feeling is valid ![‚úÖ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2705/32.png) The reasoning is not ![‚ùå](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/274c/32.png)

Most of the audience are just looking for good videos regardless of who‚Äôs made it. There‚Äôs YouTubers still going from 0 to hundreds of thousands of subscribers in months (not to rely on this, but as an example that growing from zero is still a thing - just check out one of the students from my course [John Coogan](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zu2mwpe6ks7uvzvwpfx/wnh2hghrm40v4pbl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vYy9Kb2huQ29vZ2FuUGx1cy92aWRlb3M=)) ![üöÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/32.png)

Loads of people tell me what they want to make videos about has already been done.

Well, yes of course. Nothing is original, and that‚Äôs to be expected.

But there‚Äôs an audience for everything and everyone, seriously. And there‚Äôs always a bigger audience on YouTube, the platform just seems to be getting larger - it‚Äôs not too late to jump in the game now.

**_There are no unique messages. Only unique messengers._**

##  **![üé•](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3a5/32.png) Myth 2: You Need Good Gear**

Ah the gear. I like to think I pay a good amount of attention to visuals and detail on my channel. If you‚Äôve seen my [gear page](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zu2mwpe6ks7uvzvwpfx/reh8hohqk76v7ls6/aHR0cHM6Ly9raXQuY28vYWxpYWJkYWFsP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1BbGklMjdzJTIwUGFydC1UaW1lJTIwWW91VHViZXIlMjBDcmFzaC1Db3Vyc2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlcg==), it looks pretty expensive. It‚Äôs not a beginners setup. It grew as my channel did.

All you need to get started is your smartphone (not even a stand, use a box or some books to prop it up ![üìö](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4da/32.png)) and a mic off Amazon. You‚Äôll be fine. My friend [Elizabeth](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zu2mwpe6ks7uvzvwpfx/08hwh9hmnxlwx3bp/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vY2hhbm5lbC9VQ1VGRkhYdnpBTVJTRDhCcTRiSnBweFE_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVy) got to 1k subscribers in two months using just an iPhone camera, and she‚Äôs gradually upgraded her gear as she‚Äôs grown, just like I did.

In fact, if you want to get started with filming videos using just your phone, I‚Äôve made a [video explaining exactly how to do that](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zu2mwpe6ks7uvzvwpfx/8ghqhohgw3rp3ril/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9Kd2hzUGROMlJOZz91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249QWxpJTI3cyUyMFBhcnQtVGltZSUyMFlvdVR1YmVyJTIwQ3Jhc2gtQ291cnNlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1SZXZ1ZSUyMG5ld3NsZXR0ZXI=) ![ü§ô](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f919/32.png)

If you can and want to invest in gear - absolutely do it. It‚Äôs definitely a plus (more on gear later), but it‚Äôs nowhere near enough reason not to get started. Get some natural lighting, prop up your phone and press record. It‚Äôs definitely good enough.

##  **![üëΩ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f47d/32.png) Myth 3: You Need To Know What Your Niche Is**

_‚ÄòBut I‚Äôm interested in so many things.‚Äô ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what to talk about.‚Äô ‚ÄòWho would I make videos for?_‚Äô

Honestly, you never really have your niche truly defined.

You change, they change, times change, it‚Äôs all super-fluid. And literally everyone feels the same way when they start.

We all sometimes think there‚Äôs nothing interesting about us and equally that we can‚Äôt find ‚Äòjust one thing‚Äô to make videos about.

It‚Äôs normal.

Just pick one. The smaller your niche at the start, the better.

And then make one video. It‚Äôll give you ideas for a second. Maybe if you‚Äôre lucky to get a question in the comments, there‚Äôs a third.

If you‚Äôre in it for the long haul, know your niche will change anyways - my channel‚Äôs certainly changed over the years. Just find something you can talk about for 3 minutes and film it.

Figure out the rest as you go ![‚ù§Ô∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2764_fe0f/32.png)

##  **![üó£](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f5e3/32.png) Myth 4: You Need To Be a Good Public Speaker**

Not going to lie, this one kind of makes me smile. Do you need to be a good public speaker? Absolutely not. If you haven‚Äôt spoken on camera before, chances are, you‚Äôll find your on-screen self to be an awkward mess for the first few videos ![ü•¥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f974/32.png)

That‚Äôs not to put you off. That‚Äôs to say it takes at least 10 videos to get used to it. And that everyone will - it‚Äôs a practised skill. When someone comes to me asking how to improve their speech on camera, I won‚Äôt really say anything until they‚Äôve got at least 10 videos out.

Go to your favourite YouTuber‚Äôs first videos (you can filter by date) and enjoy the awkward mess that is everyone‚Äôs first few attempts at filming ![üòâ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f609/32.png) The sooner you start, the sooner you get past this mandatory learning curve.

##  **![üôà](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f648/32.png) Myth 5: I‚Äôm Too Scared To Start, YouTubers Are Confident**

I used to be terrified of putting myself out there. But then, 5 years ago, I read a book called [_Show Your Work_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zu2mwpe6ks7uvzvwpfx/vqh3hrhnm4w34qsw/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL2RhNzY=) by Austin Kleon that changed my life.

It‚Äôs a book about self-promotion for people who hate the idea of self-promotion ![üò≥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f633/32.png)

It helped me start my blog, and the first post I made in January 2016 was called [_How to get over the fear of starting a blog_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/4zu2mwpe6ks7uvzvwpfx/l2hehmhoq4xv4ptg/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL2ZlYXItb2YtYmxvZ2dpbmcvP3V0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1BbGklMjdzJTIwUGFydC1UaW1lJTIwWW91VHViZXIlMjBDcmFzaC1Db3Vyc2UmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPVJldnVlJTIwbmV3c2xldHRlcg==)_._ In the post, I explained my thought-processes about how scared I was to start putting myself out there, and broke down the ways I got over it.

‚ÄúI have to be confident to start YouTube‚Äù is a myth because almost no one‚Äôs confident when they start. Competence breeds confidence ![üîÑ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f504/32.png)

The more you practise, the better you‚Äôll get. It just takes that first step to get started, and the first step is always the hardest.

If you‚Äôre terrified, you‚Äôre in good company. Just know that everyone else who‚Äôs starting, is just as scared and doing it anyway.

----

Being all-in doesn‚Äôt mean you do YouTube and only YouTube. I was making **2-3 videos a week for 3 years** before I finally decided to leave my day job as a doctor.

I‚Äôm a huge fan of [side hustles](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvu39vnkogt6un9nm4a7/vqh3hrhnm30330hw/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj00VjJad2dKdzYySSZ0PTExNjVz), so naturally I‚Äôm a huge fan YouTube being a Part-Time thing.

Finding content ideas, planning out videos, filming and editing - these can seem like an endless amount of work. But it really doesn‚Äôt need to take over your life, and you can very well manage it alongside everything else. Here are 5 techniques for doing just that:

##  **![üß±](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f9f1/32.png) 1: Batching**

If you‚Äôre anything like me, your room probably isn‚Äôt always camera-ready. If you‚Äôre someone who tries to look presentable, _you_ might not always be ready either. Whether it‚Äôs getting into the headspace to film a video, making sure the background looks ok or making sure your camera settings are ok, there‚Äôs always just so much friction to getting started. And when you‚Äôre filming multiple videos in a week you can waste just so much time ‚Äògetting ready‚Äô to film.

![üöÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/32.png) The way forward is _batching ![üöÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/32.png)_ 

Pick a day. Maybe once a week or fortnight. Maybe if you‚Äôre super pro, once a month. Sit down, and film yourself doing 2, 3, maybe 5 videos at a time. It‚Äôs honestly game-changing. This way you don‚Äôt need to keep setting things up again and again every time you want to get 30 minutes of filming done. Trust me, it‚Äôs so simple but saves tonnes of time.

##  **![ü•∑](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f977/32.png) 2: Stealing Ideas Like An Artist**

One of the biggest things I‚Äôve heard from people just starting out is a concern around coming up with enough ideas. A huge part of this comes from wanting to create ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô content.

It‚Äôs a total myth that ideas are original. They really aren‚Äôt.

Some of the biggest artists themselves refer to their work as ‚Äò[stealing](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvu39vnkogt6un9nm4a7/l2hehmhoqv2vv7tg/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL0lBV0FiT1I_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVy)‚Äô. Of course, there are lines one can cross, but if you‚Äôre a beginner, you‚Äôre really very safe. Chances are, you won‚Äôt have the equipment, time or resources to create videos _exactly_ like the ones you see. So you‚Äôre fine. Honestly, go for anything ![ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f937_200d_2642_fe0f/32.png)

Once you let go of this idea of wanting to create something original every time (btw, if you can, go for it), you‚Äôll find so many ideas already out there.

Create what you like to see. Make it authentic to you and you‚Äôre golden ![‚òÄÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2600_fe0f/32.png)

‚ÄòCreativity‚Äô really doesn‚Äôt have to be that difficult.

##  **![üõ§](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f6e4/32.png) 3: Parallel Processing**

There are 2 types of task - _heavy lifts ![üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3cb_fe0f_200d_2640_fe0f/32.png)_ and _slow burns ![üî•](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f525/32.png)_ 

A heavy lift is sitting down with a blank screen (or paper) and trying to plan out a video from nothing: no title, no topic, no ideas. Unless you have endless time, this process in unlikely to be enjoyable or sustainable.

In contrast, a slow burn is much more juicy. This is where you‚Äôre able to **chip away at multiple projects at the same time**.

Let‚Äôs say you see a video that resonates with you - write this title and idea somewhere. Seen a thumbnail you can recreate? Screenshot it. You read a sentence in a book making a good argument on a subject you‚Äôre interested in - add it to your resources.

Just being proactive like this means you‚Äôll **never need to start from a blank page**. You‚Äôll always have multiple little half-formed or almost-fully-scripted videos waiting for you at all times. If you block some time to add finishing touches - your content will seriously never stop flowing.

Since I‚Äôve expanded my team our workflow system has undergone a bunch of changes, so I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see a video about that sometime soon. Safe to say we arrive on a Monday with no more than a couple of one-sentence video ideas, which get fleshed out throughout the week ![üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3c3_200d_2642_fe0f/32.png)

##  **![üèõ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3db/32.png) 4: Systematic Structuring**

So you have your idea, you have some bullet-points on what you want to say - how do you turn that into a video? This is a huge topic, but here are some structuring guides that will help:

**Listicles ![üî¢](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f522/32.png)** 

This is where you just go through the points you want to make one by one (like this email). It requires minimal effort and can be super successful. I‚Äôve used this method in a few of my [videos.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvu39vnkogt6un9nm4a7/m2h7h5ho20500pcl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1HZzhfVEE3VTBVdw==)‚Äã

**Essay Structure ![üìù](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4dd/32.png)** 

This is what we used to do in English Literature. And there‚Äôs a reason we used it - it makes sense and sounds good. You take an intro that explains the issue. You have a body divided into sections that ideally each make a single point. You weigh options. You compare pros and cons. You summarise in the end. It‚Äôs essentially an oral essay. Here‚Äôs a pretty personal recent [example](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvu39vnkogt6un9nm4a7/dpheh0hqdw6ww9hl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1tWk9WTHJMWEtDRSZ0PTEwNzBz).

**Story Structures ![üìñ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4d6/32.png)** 

This is the Gold Standard. This is what I wish I could be doing with every video and what I‚Äôm aiming for. Humans have evolved around stories, we love them. So if you can turn what you say into a story that follows a hero‚Äôs journey, everything will become endlessly more attractive to the viewer. Make what you say **personal** and show how it has **transformed** you, and more people will be compelled to listen. A better example of what the hero‚Äôs journey actually means is this [video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvu39vnkogt6un9nm4a7/e0hph7hkmwvww8f7/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dD01M3MmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPUFsaSUyN3MlMjBQYXJ0LVRpbWUlMjBZb3VUdWJlciUyMENyYXNoLUNvdXJzZSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9UmV2dWUlMjBuZXdzbGV0dGVyJnY9SGhrNE45QTBvQ0E=). And if you want to get better at storytelling, get [Storyworthy](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvu39vnkogt6un9nm4a7/7qh7h8h0dplppnb9/aHR0cHM6Ly9nZW5pLnVzL2pzM0F4) by Matthew Dicks, it‚Äôll change how you think about stories and the world in general.

##  **![üíª](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4bb/32.png) 5: Efficient Editing**

Editing takes possibly the largest chunk of time. You‚Äôll quickly realise how many ‚Äòumms‚Äô and ‚Äòahhhs‚Äô you‚Äôre injecting after everything. Every. Other. Word.

In my book, there‚Äôs really no excuse for having poorly-edited videos. I use Final Cut Pro X, if you search you can find endless free resources to learn it online. If you want to jump straight into the YouTube editing game, I have a Skillshare Class on Video Editing with Final Cut Pro that has 39,000 students and pretty sick reviews (you can access it for free [here](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvu39vnkogt6un9nm4a7/owhkhqh4xl9ll0tq/aHR0cHM6Ly9nby5hbGlhYmRhYWwuY29tL3ZpZGVvZWRpdGluZyUyMD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249QWxpJTI3cyUyMFBhcnQtVGltZSUyMFlvdVR1YmVyJTIwQ3Jhc2gtQ291cnNlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1SZXZ1ZSUyMG5ld3NsZXR0ZXI=)) - it‚Äôll take you from beginner to pro in under 4 hours ![üöÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/32.png)

If you‚Äôve entertained the idea of starting a YouTube channel, you‚Äôve probably come across the beast of _Imposter Syndrome_. The feeling of ‚Äòwhy on earth would anyone listen to me?‚Äô ![ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f937_200d_2640_fe0f/32.png)

This is a feeling that every YouTuber and content creator suffers from.

I‚Äôve been battling it since day 1, and I continue to fight it everyday.

Why would I be qualified to make videos about study methods? I‚Äôm not the best student in the world ![üåç](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f30d/32.png)

Why would I be qualified to make videos about tech or productivity? I‚Äôm not an expert.

Why would I even make this email Crash Course about being a YouTuber? I‚Äôm still under 3m subscribers - there are people out there who are infinitely more successful on YouTube than I am. Why would anyone read what I‚Äôve got to say?

If this is a feeling you‚Äôve ever suffered from, hopefully you‚Äôll find this email useful.

It‚Äôs some of the stuff I remind myself of when the _Imposter Syndrome_ beast rears its ugly head ![üê∫](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f43a/32.png)

##  **![üíÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f480/32.png) 1: The Curse of Knowledge**

If you‚Äôre waiting to become an ‚Äòexpert‚Äô (whatever that means) before you get started on YouTube, you‚Äôre approaching it all wrong.

Something which isn‚Äôt said enough is that **90% of your audience will be complete beginners**.

Even when you‚Äôre targeting professionals (trust me, I‚Äôve tried).

And the issue with an expert teaching a beginner, is that they‚Äôre so out-of-touch and on a different level that they struggle to remember what the experience of the beginner is like. They just can‚Äôt connect well. CS Lewis called this the ‚ÄòCurse of Knowledge‚Äô.

##  **![üí°](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4a1/32.png) 2: You Don‚Äôt Need to Know a Thing to Get Started on YouTube**

By still figuring things out, by being open and on a journey, even by being a bit of a mess, you‚Äôre likely to be relatable and likeable. A good mix.

You can give tips and advice the audience can immediately take away, and you can bring them along as you improve.

Just like it‚Äôs never too late to start, when we‚Äôre talking about what we know about a subject, **it‚Äôs never too early to start ![üï∞](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f570/32.png)** 

You can make a video on how you‚Äôre starting something tomorrow; on why you‚Äôre thinking of starting to learn something; on figuring out how to find something to start to learn. Literally anything goes.

##  **![ü§ù](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f91d/32.png) 3: Guide Not Guru**

Another thing I keep in mind is that no matter what I ‚Äòteach‚Äô or explain - I put myself in the position of a **Guide** rather than that of a **Guru ![üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f6b6_200d_2642_fe0f/32.png)** 

I never paint myself as someone who‚Äôs figured it all out and is spreading his wisdom (the Guru). I‚Äôm just some guy with a camera who‚Äôs trying something out to see if it works and sharing his journey with others (Guide). If you‚Äôre the latter, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong.

And as a last point, Guru credentials really don‚Äôt matter. No one cares how many diplomas you have, they just want useful content.

I know I‚Äôve played the Cambridge card to death but I‚Äôm still no expert - I wasn‚Äôt the best candidate who ever interviewed there, even though I was making videos about it. I certainly wasn‚Äôt anywhere near the best student there, even though I was making videos about how to study.

But people still enjoyed learning from me, as I was figuring stuff out.

Talk about what you‚Äôre figuring out, and you‚Äôll be fine.

##  **![üò≥](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f633/32.png) 4: You‚Äôre Supposed to Feel Uncomfortable**

So when it comes to imposter syndrome, it may feel as though you don‚Äôt yet have the credentials to talk about what you wanna talk about.

You think that maybe in a few months, if you just read a few more books or spent a few more weeks thinking about your video ideas, you‚Äôd feel like less of an imposter in front of that camera.

But I‚Äôve got some bad news ![üëé](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f44e/32.png)

That feeling will always be lurking, and our only option is to push through it ![üí™](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4aa/32.png)

‚Äã[I spoke with Steven Bartlett on his no.1 podcast _The Diary of a CEO_ last year](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8un7l09dmh9u494kvs2/wnh2hghrm3wlx5al/aHR0cHM6Ly9vcGVuLnNwb3RpZnkuY29tL2VwaXNvZGUvMDdlS2FvQWd1VjR3c1FTelRNQXJueT9zaT16MExwUlhheVJOUzZtekpHT3hMdkV3), and after the interview, he gave me an absolutely life changing piece of advice about imposter syndrome.

We‚Äôll probably spend most of our lives feeling like we‚Äôre ‚Äònot supposed to be‚Äô in a certain place, or that we don‚Äôt deserve it, and yet we achieve everything we ever have despite those feelings.

What it boils down to is that we grow exponentially when we‚Äôre uncomfortable.

Check out the video [here](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8un7l09dmh9u494kvs2/08hwh9hmnkdpgxup/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9UcEJoc2ZyZVU1UT90PTIyMw==) to hear it straight from Steven.

If you read the email I sent on day 2, you might remember me suggesting that you could literally get your phone out right now, find some natural lighting, and hit record on your first video. Because that really is all there is to it, as far as getting started goes ![üëä](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f44a/32.png)

But this might seem a bit _too_ easy. Just talk to your phone and upload onto YouTube? Surely it‚Äôs not that simple. Not everyone ends up with a massive channel. There must be some secret sauce to becoming a successful YouTuber ![ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f937_200d_2642_fe0f/32.png)

And you‚Äôre absolutely right.

Getting your phone out and hitting record is great for getting started but there‚Äôs definitely more to ‚Äòmaking it on YouTube‚Äô.

Today I want to take you through **the Top 5 things I think it takes to succeed**.

##  **![üîÅ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f501/32.png) 1: Consistency**

This is perhaps the single, most non-negotiable, biggest determinant of your success on YouTube. And it‚Äôs not glamorous.

Pick a schedule and stick to it. _Religiously_. There‚Äôs so many reasons to do this.

Firstly, the YouTube algorithm favours consistent, regular creators. And you always want the algorithm on your side.

Secondly, you want someone to come to your channel and see a consistent backlog of content - if your last video is from 3 months ago and the one before that from 2018, it‚Äôs very very unlikely they‚Äôll subscribe. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt, would you?!?

And thirdly, you want to establish an expectation, especially as you‚Äôre trying to grow. Commit to uploading on a set day each week and _stick to it_. People will start to get hyped for your weekly video.

If you post once on Wednesday and the next week on Friday and then on Sunday, people won‚Äôt know what to expect and will quickly switch off.

Before I hit 2 million subscribers, I was uploading 2-3 videos **every week** without fail. Things have changed a little now I‚Äôve got an established audience and have started to expand the business, but I attribute a huge amount of my early growth to my consistency.

##  **![üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f9d8_200d_2642_fe0f/32.png) 2: Faith and Patience**

Let me break something to you (if you hadn‚Äôt worked it out already) - YouTube is not easy ![üò©](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f629/32.png)

This isn‚Äôt a get-rich-quick-scheme. For the huge majority of us, it‚Äôs a lot of work, for a long time, with absolutely no reward.

It took me 6 months and posting 53 videos to hit 1,000 subscribers. That is months of idea generating, editing, and churning out videos with little to no audience.

And the difference between those who make it and those who don‚Äôt is giving up in that painful period.

Be ready for zero views, zero engagement, zero subscribers. Expect the sound of crickets for months and months.

Set your expectations and be patient. It‚Äôs the only way to succeed ![üöÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f680/32.png)

##  **![üí™](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4aa/32.png) 3: Hard Work**

Yep, it‚Äôs really no different to anything else. You have to put in the time, even when you don‚Äôt feel like it.

You‚Äôre guaranteed to find some parts harder than others: maybe you particularly dislike being on camera, or editing will take a while to learn, or you hate filming in public. But what‚Äôs absolutely certain is that you‚Äôll improve in all these areas over time. And the skills and discipline they give you are amazing and transferrable.

##  **![üëÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f440/32.png) 4: Unfair Advantages**

These are really worth spending a bit of time thinking about.

What will make you stand out? ![‚úã](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/270b/32.png)

What things are you fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to have that you can focus on?

I was a medical student (‚Äòhard‚Äô to achieve), at Cambridge University (mysterious, prestigious). I had good camera gear and knew a thing or two about making things look pretty so my videos seemed well designed and stood out from other medics.

How can you stack the deck in your favour? ![‚ô†Ô∏è](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2660_fe0f/32.png)

It might be having the money to buy the best gear out there and have sick production value from day one, or it might be your poor gut health prompting you to try different diets you can talk about.

We all have unfair advantages, it‚Äôs just a matter of realising what they are. (If you‚Äôre up for it, I talk about it more in [this](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu3vek974tguv0vnksl/p8heh9h9r73kg0cr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1SR2JDUl9wcTRfQSZ0PTQycw==) video)

##  **![üçÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f340/32.png) 5: Luck**

At the end of the day, growth and all numerical measures of success depend a great deal on luck.

And while you can‚Äôt really do much to increase your luck, you can definitely make sure that you stack the deck in your favour so when luck does come your way, you‚Äôre ready to seize the opportunity.

Posting regularly a couple of times a week will increase the chances that one of your videos will pop off. It‚Äôs like buying lottery tickets.

So you can‚Äôt literally produce luck but you can, to some extent, manufacture the conditions for luck to appear.

Hey friend,

When someone‚Äôs truly serious about YouTube, they quickly start asking me: _What camera should I buy? Do I need a ringlight? Where do you put your mic, I can never see it in your videos?_

Before I give you my Ultimate Notion page about Gear, I‚Äôll summarise some key points here:

1.   ![üîÅ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f501/32.png) Nothing is more important than **consistency** and putting out content in the first place.
2.   ![üì±](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4f1/32.png) You can just get started with your phone if you absolutely must. [Here‚Äôs a video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8kugd7epv2t3uzezw5tk/g3hnh5hegzw442c3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dD0zcyZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249QWxpJTI3cyUyMFBhcnQtVGltZSUyMFlvdVR1YmVyJTIwQ3Jhc2gtQ291cnNlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1SZXZ1ZSUyMG5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdj1Kd2hzUGROMlJOZw==) where I explain how.
3.   ![üì∏](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4f8/32.png) You should consider upgrading your gear based on how seriously you want to take YouTube.
4.   ![üéô](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f399/32.png) The most important thing is audio. **People will sit through bad video quality but no one will sit through bad audio quality** - a microphone should be your first purchase.

With all that in mind, here‚Äôs the [**Ultimate Notion page**](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/8kugd7epv2t3uzezw5tk/z2hr57k0inho5dxqqgiz/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm90aW9uLnNvL1lvdVR1YmUtR2Vhci1mb3ItRGlmZmVyZW50LUJ1ZGdldHMtY2MwZGQ5OTJlOWQxNDhkMjk5ZjQ4OTg5ZDQ5MDAzY2E=) - enjoy!

There‚Äôs a lot of stuff in it, but if anything‚Äôs unclear please feel free to leave a comment on the page and I‚Äôll try to address it. The only homework today is to familiarise yourself with that gear page and pay particular attention to the _Level 1_ options, so you can start thinking about what your first YouTube setup might include.

Now that you‚Äôre fully equipped to get started, we need to make sure you keep going and don‚Äôt stop ![üí™](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4aa/32.png)

Being super-pumped about something only to drop it after a short while is something you may be familiar with (I may or may not do this myself ![üëÄ](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f440/32.png)).

In a game where consistency is everything, you don‚Äôt want to be depending on your fickle motivation to succeed. Here‚Äôs two ways you can make sure you don‚Äôt let yourself slack.

##  **![ü§ù](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f91d/32.png) 1 - Accountability**

One thing stronger than the desire to procrastinate may just be the embarrassment of not sticking to a promised schedule. Finding an accountability partner to hold you to account is absolutely game changing.

My top tips for a good accountability partner are:

1.   ![üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f9d1_200d_1f91d_200d_1f9d1/32.png) Find someone you‚Äôre not too close with (if you‚Äôre already too comfortable with them, this isn‚Äôt going to work)
2.   ![üîß](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f527/32.png) Find someone who also has projects of their own they want to be held accountable for (it‚Äôs a two-way street after all)
3.   ![ü§ë](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f911/32.png) Put money on the line. Seriously. If I promise my flatmate I‚Äôll give her $1000 if I don‚Äôt film a video today, chances are, I‚Äôm really going to do it (if you‚Äôre not willing to make that promise, do you really want to get the thing done?)

##  **![üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f468_200d_1f469_200d_1f467_200d_1f466/32.png) 2 - Community**

Working with others in the same boat is game changing.

You don‚Äôt feel mad. You don‚Äôt feel alone. You learn from other beginners‚Äô mistakes. You get inspired by other‚Äôs work. You get all your little questions easily answered. You get to see those going through the next few steps ahead of you. You get to bounce ideas off many different people and you have a bunch of constant support from others who know exactly what you‚Äôre going through ![üòá](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f607/32.png)

I can‚Äôt explain just how much of a difference this all makes.

But this is hard to find.

We‚Äôve built a community like this in the Part Time YouTuber Academy. We‚Äôve now taught over 1500 students, and previously cohort spaces have sold out in just a couple of hours. I‚Äôll send you an email before the next cohort opens if you‚Äôre interested in joining.

## how to structure your videos

The way we can get that structure is through a simple tool that I call the **HIVEs Framework**. That is:

üé£ **H**ook

üëã **I**ntro

ü§ë **V**alue

üëâ **E**nd **S**creen Sales Pitch

Using this framework you can turn every video (and video script) into a cohesive piece of film to guarantee your content performs well.

You always want to start with a üé£ **Hook**. This is your title, thumbnail, and first 30 seconds of your video. Things that should grab the attention of a potential viewer and keep them watching.

Then you move on to the üëã **Intro**. Once they‚Äôve decided to watch your video, you need to explain the _why_ behind it. Tell your viewers why they should keep watching, what you‚Äôre explaining/providing/going to show and how that thing relates to their situation.

Next is ü§ë **Value**. Throughout the whole video, you want to show the value of your production through elements of writing (video script) and branding (video editing). The point is to make it memorable and to stand out compared to the rest of the productions in the same niche. Here‚Äôs where you make them say ‚ÄúWow, they really took time to make this video special.‚Äù

And you want to finish it off with the üëâ **End Screen Sales Pitch**. You don‚Äôt want to leave your viewers with just a blank ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù. The best thing you can do is relate the end bit of a video with another video on that correlating topic. Take a look at [this video](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmunrwml3eh6hrnrooda5/p8heh9hzk52n3dtr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1saHBZMWZyTnFkQQ==) as an example. This way you‚Äôll keep them in a loop and you create a situation where people genuinely want to check out your next video. And given that they‚Äôve already watched one of your videos until the end, chances are that they‚Äôll like to watch the next one.
